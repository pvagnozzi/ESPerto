.SYNOPSIS
    üîí Generate a self-signed SSL certificate and private key for ESPerto project.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script creates a self-signed certificate (server.crt) and private key (server.key)
    using OpenSSL. The files are generated in the 'certs' directory and copied to 'data/certs'
    for use with SPIFFS or other embedded filesystems.

.NOTES
    - Requires OpenSSL to be installed and available in PATH.
    - Run this script from any location; paths are resolved automatically.
    - Certificate is valid for 365 days and uses 2048-bit RSA.
    - Customize the subject fields as needed for your environment.
